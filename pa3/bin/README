----------------------------------------------
ACKNOWLEDGE ANY OUTSIDE SOURCES

List here any code you submitted for this assignment that was written
with significant help of a course staff member, or code used from the
textbook.  Be specific about what methods or algorithms are involved,
and what sections of the textbook are involved (if applicable): [you do
not need to list any of the code that we wrote for the assignment,
i.e., the contents of the starter files for the assignment]

KNOWN BUGS or LIMITATIONS:

ANY OTHER NOTES FOR THE GRADER:

1. For the commands like creating a polynomial with odd number of inputs, the
program ignores the last input value and even if it is anything other than a 
double like a character, the program ignores it and does not throw any error.
Since the specification for such kind of cases is not clear in the problem 
description, I believe that this is the right behaviour.
